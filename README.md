# Eat-Da-Burger!
## Description
For this project, I created a burger logger that follows the MVC design patten. 
Eat-Da-Burger lets users submit a type of burger. This burger is populated on   
the left side of the screen with an option to devour it. When the devour button   
is clicked, the burger will then populate to the right side of the screen with  
 an option to delete it.
